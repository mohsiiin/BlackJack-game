# Basic BlackJack rules.
The goal of blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21. Face cards are worth 10. Aces are worth 1 or 11, whichever makes a better hand. Each player starts with two cards, one of the dealer's cards is hidden until the end. Cou can raise a hit to ask for an extra card. or raise stand to go with your cards
